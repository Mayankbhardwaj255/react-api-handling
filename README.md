# API Handling in ReactJS – Pro Level 🚀

This repository showcases powerful and efficient techniques for handling APIs in **ReactJS**. It includes real-world examples of fetching data, handling CORS, managing race conditions, and building custom React queries. Whether you're learning or leveling up your API skills, this project covers it all.

### 🔥 Features
- Fetching data using **Axios**
- Handling **CORS** with proxy
- Solving **race conditions** with `AbortController`
- Creating **Custom React Query** patterns
- Comparing various data fetching strategies

The project is structured with two main directories:

- **frontend/** - Contains the ReactJS frontend logic
- **backend/** - Mock/backend server setup

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mayankbhardwaj255/react-api-handling.git
cd your-repo-name
```

⚠️ If you encounter an error like:
```sh
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Mayankbhardwaj255/react-api-handling.git/': 
Failed to connect to github.com port 443: Could not connect to server
```
Try the following:
- ✅ Check internet connection
- 🔁 Restart router/modem
- 🔐 Disable VPN/firewall temporarily
- 🔄 Use SSH instead:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Mayankbhardwaj255/react-api-handling.git
```
- 🌐 Use alternate port:

git clone https://github.com/Mayankbhardwaj255/react-api-handling.git
```
- 🛠️ Check [GitHub Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/)

2. **Install Dependencies**
Navigate into both `backend` and `frontend` directories:

```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

```sh
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## 🧪 Running the Project

### Start the Backend
```sh
cd backend
npm start
```
